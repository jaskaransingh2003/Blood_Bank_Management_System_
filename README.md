🩸 BLOOD BANK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING MySQL

<br/>


📌 Project Overview

The Blood Bank Management System is a database-driven project designed to efficiently manage and monitor blood donations, donors, recipients, hospitals, and blood bank staff. The system aims to streamline the data handling process of a blood bank and provide fast and reliable access to crucial information related to blood inventory and management. This project uses MySQL to design a relational database and perform various operations, including data insertion, retrieval, filtering, and complex queries. It serves as an ideal example of database normalization, table relationships, indexing, and real-world query practices.

<br/>


🎯 Features

- Store and manage donor and Recipient details.
- Record and track blood types, donation dates, and availability.
- Manage the Recording staff, hospital information, and city-wise blood inventory.
- Find donors based on blood type, location, and last donation date.
- Use of SQL Joins, Group By, Subqueries, and Aggregate Functions.
- Normalized database structure for real-world use cases.

🧱 Database Schema

The database contains the following main tables:

| Table Name             | Description                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| blood_donor          | Stores donor details and blood type          |
| blood_recipient      | Stores patient/recipient details             |
| blood_specimen       | Tracks different blood types and stock       |
| recording_staff      | Information about blood bank staff           |
| city                 | Stores city and location data                |
| disease_finder       | Tracks diseases that prevent donation       |
| bb_manager           | Blood Bank manager information               |
| hospital_info        | Information of hospitals linked to the bank  |
